Returns the amount of seconds since 0000 AD.
To get the only the seconds, place the first line at the top line of your custom command and use `{var|seconds}` or `{seconds}` whenever you need the seconds since 0000 AD.
You can get the rest by using `{minutes}`, `{hours}`, etc.
No longer useful following Update 73.1 which introduced `{date}`

Makes it so that only 1 user can use certain commands. It's really good for security!

Changes spaces to "%20" because that's how spaces are encoded in URLs. Good for APIs or searching commands.
