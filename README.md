# Better Robotop
A repository for cool custom commands for the [Discord bot](https://discord.com/developers/docs/intro#bots-and-apps), [Robotop](https://robotop.xyz)
The bot has a very versatile and [dynamic custom command](https://robotop.xyz/customcommands/dynamic) system that allows for very advanced custom commands that have API-esque properties. It can [decode unix time](https://github.com/toxicscientist/Better-Robotop/blob/master/tools/SecondsSince0000AD.yaml), [perform simple mathematics](https://github.com/toxicscientist/Better-Robotop/blob/master/commands/math-remastered.yaml) and much more with incredibly simple commands

### Command/Tool Installation:

```
Put the necessary code as a custom command
Change variables as necessary but be careful, too many changes can break commands
```
