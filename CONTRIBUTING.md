# Here are some good guidelines to make a good contribution:

### Commands should be understandable
A hard to understand command is pretty much useless. Hard to understand commands are difficult to maintain, difficult to edit and just a massive bummer for all involved.

### Comments are helpful
There's no solid way to add comments to Robotop commands but comments really help with the problem above. They also really ✨flare up❤️ Your commands. A good work around for the lack off comments is using `{var|comment1|<YOUR COMMENT HERE>}`.

### Follow the [Code of Conduct][CoC]
[CoC]: https://github.com/toxicscientist/Better-Robotop/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md

We have pretty loose rules. In fact, almost all of our rules have a massive amount of leeway before we get the hounds on you. However, we still have rules, rules that should be followed as closely as possible and these rules are outlined in the Code of Conduct. Read it before contributing even a smidge of a command.

That concludes our guidelines. Keep an eye on here though, anything could change without any warning. :)
